# Predictive-Maintenance
 The goal of this project is to develop a predictive maintenance system for a manufacturing plant. Predictive maintenance aims to predict when equipment failures might occur and to prevent these failures by performing maintenance at the right time. This system can help reduce downtime, save costs, and improve the overall efficiency of the plant.
